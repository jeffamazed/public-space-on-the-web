# Public Space on the Web

**Public Space on the Web** is a collaborative, live-editable website: anyone can visit, view, and edit the site's files directly from the browser. It's a minimal, hackable playground for sharing and remixing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any text file‚Äîpowered by a simple Node.js HTTP server.

> **Note:** This is a public, open, and intentionally insecure demo space. Anything you or others edit is instantly live for everyone.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Edit the webpage from the webpage itself:**  
  Browse and edit files (including HTML, CSS, JS) using a web-based editor.
- **Live updates:**  
  Changes are saved instantly and visible to all visitors.
- **Minimal server:**  
  Handles GET, PUT, DELETE, and MKCOL (make directory) requests for file manipulation.
- **No authentication:**  
  Anyone can read or write files. Perfect for play, demos, and experimenting.
